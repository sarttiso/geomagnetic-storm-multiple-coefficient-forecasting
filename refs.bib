@article{Chakraborty2020,
abstract = {Geomagnetic activity is often described using summary indices to summarize the likelihood of space weather impacts, as well as when parameterizing space weather models. The geomagnetic index K p in particular, is widely used for these purposes. Current state-of-the-art forecast models provide deterministic K p predictions using a variety of methods – including empirically-derived functions, physics-based models, and neural networks – but do not provide uncertainty estimates associated with the forecast. This paper provides a sample methodology to generate a 3-hour-ahead K p prediction with uncertainty bounds and from this provide a probabilistic geomagnetic storm forecast. Specifically, we have used a two-layered architecture to separately predict storm ( K p ≥ 5 − ) and non-storm cases. As solar wind-driven models are limited in their ability to predict the onset of transient-driven activity we also introduce a model variant using solar X-ray flux to assess whether simple models including proxies for solar activity can improve the predictions of geomagnetic storm activity with lead times longer than the L1-to-Earth propagation time. By comparing the performance of these models we show that including operationally-available information about solar irradiance enhances the ability of predictive models to capture the onset of geomagnetic storms and that this can be achieved while also enabling probabilistic forecasts.},

@article{Brahma2016,
abstract = {Deep hierarchical representations of the data have been found out to provide better informative features for several machine learning applications. In addition, multilayer neural networks surprisingly tend to achieve better performance when they are subject to an unsupervised pretraining. The booming of deep learning motivates researchers to identify the factors that contribute to its success. One possible reason identified is the flattening of manifold-shaped data in higher layers of neural networks. However, it is not clear how to measure the flattening of such manifold-shaped data and what amount of flattening a deep neural network can achieve. For the first time, this paper provides quantitative evidence to validate the flattening hypothesis. To achieve this, we propose a few quantities for measuring manifold entanglement under certain assumptions and conduct experiments with both synthetic and real-world data. Our experimental results validate the proposition and lead to new insights on deep learning.},

@article{Lin2017,
abstract = {We show how the success of deep learning could depend not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can frequently be approximated through “cheap learning” with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones. We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various “no-flattening theorems” showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss; for example, we show that n variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2 n neurons in a single hidden layer.},

abstract = {We here present a model for real time forecasting of the geomagnetic index Dst. The model consists of a recurrent neural network that has been optimized to be as small as possible without degrading the accuracy. It is driven solely by hourly averages of the solar wind magnetic field component Bz, particle density n, and velocity V, which means that the model does not rely on observed Dst. In an evaluation based on more than 40,000 hours of solar wind and Dst data, it is shown that this model has smaller errors than other models currently in operational use. A complete description of the model is given in an appendix.},

abstract = {Severe geomagnetic storms caused by the solar wind disturbances have harmful influences on the operation of modern equipment and systems. The modeling and forecasting of AE index are extremely useful to understand the geomagnetic substorms. This study presents a novel cloud-nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) model to predict AE index 1 hr ahead. The cloud-NARX model provides AE index forecasting results, with a correlation coefficient of 0.87 on the data of whole year 2015. The benchmarks on the data of the two interested periods of 17–21 March 2015 and 22–26 June 2015 are presented. The presented model uses uncertainty “cloud” model and cloud transformation to quantify the uncertainty throughout the structure detection, parameter estimation, and model prediction. The new predicted band can be generated to forecast AE index with confidence interval. The proposed method provides a new way to evaluate the model based on uncertainty analysis, revealing the reliability of model, and visualize the bias of model prediction.},

@article{Wintoft2018,
abstract = {Models that predict the Kp and Dst indices are evaluated using solar wind data at L1. The models consist of ensembles of neural networks that have been developed using ACE Level 2 data from the period 1998–2015. The use of ensembles is motivated by the difficulty of generating functions that generalize well in regions of the input-output space that are poorly sampled, which typically occurs during stronger events. Since the launch of the DSCOVR spacecraft, providing measurements from about August 2016, new and independent data have become available to test the models. ACE Level 2 data for almost the same period are also available, representing another independent set collected after 2015. We evaluate the models using plots and various statistical measures. We also study the performance of the predictions for lead times up to 3 hr. The results show that the models perform better when using ACE or cleaned DSCOVR data compared to the real-time DSCOVR data and that lead times of L1-Earth travel time plus a maximum of 1 hr are possible. As the models use only solar wind for their inputs, and the temporal dynamics of Kp and Dst are very different, we see significant differences in the error distributions that we believe are related to long-term changes in Dst that are not captured by the Dst prediction model.},

@article{Daglis2007,
abstract = {This chapter reviews the current understanding of ring current dynamics. The terrestrial ring current is an electric current flowing toroidally around the Earth, centered at the equatorial plane and at altitudes of 10,000 to 60,000 km. Enhancements in this current are responsible for global decreases in the Earth's surface magnetic field, which have been used to define geomagnetic storms. Intense geospace magnetic storms have severe effects on technological systems, such as disturbances or even permanent damage of telecommunication and navigation satellites, telecommunication cables, and power grids. The main carriers of the ring current are positive ions, with energies from 1 keV to a few hundred keV, which are trapped by the geomagnetic field and undergo an azimuthal drift. The ring current is formed by the injection of ions originating in the solar wind and the terrestrial ionosphere into the inner magnetosphere. The injection process involves electric fields, associated with enhanced magnetospheric convection and/or magnetospheric substorms. The quiescent ring current is carried mainly by protons of predominantly solar wind origin, while active processes in geospace tend to increase the abundance (both absolute and relative) of O+ ions, which are of ionospheric origin. During intense geospace magnetic storms, the O+ abundance increases dramatically. This increase has been observed to occur concurrently with the rapid intensification of the ring current in the storm main phase and to result in O+ dominance around storm maximum. This compositional change can affect several dynamic processes, such as species-and energy-dependent charge-exchange and wave-particle scattering loss. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.},

abstract = {The reliability diagram is a common diagnostic graph used to summarize and evaluate probabilistic forecasts. Its strengths lie in the ease with which it is produced and the transparency of its definition. While visually appealing, major long-noted shortcomings lie in the difficulty of interpreting the graph visually; for the most part, ambiguities arise from variations in the distributions of forecast probabilities and from various binning procedures. A resampling method for assigning consistency bars to the observed frequencies is introduced that allows for immediate visual evaluation as to just how likely the observed relative frequencies are under the assumption that the predicted probabilities are reliable. Further, an alternative presentation of the same information on probability paper eases quantitative evaluation and comparison. Both presentations can easily be employed for any method of binning. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven or corotating interaction region (CIR)-driven storms can change the electron distributions in the radiation belt dramatically, which can in turn affect the spacecraft in this region or induce geomagnetic effects. The Van Allen Probes twin spacecraft, launched on 30 August 2012, orbit near the equatorial plane and across a wide range of L∗ with apogee at 5.8 RE and perigee at 620 km. Electron data from Van Allen Probes MagEIS and REPT instruments have been binned every 6 h at L∗=3 (defined as 2.5 {\textless} L∗{\textless}3.5), 4 (3.5 {\textless} L∗{\textless}4.5), 5 (4.5 {\textless} L∗{\textless}5.5). The superposed epoch analysis shows that (1) CME storms induce more electron flux enhancement at L∗=3 for energy channels below 1 MeV than CIR storms; (2) CME storms induce more electron flux enhancement at L∗=4 and 5 in the energy channels above 1 MeV than CIR storms; (3) CIR storms induce more electron flux enhancement at L∗=4 and 5 in the energy channels below 1 MeV than CME storms; (4) intense CME induce more than 50 times flux enhancement for the energy channel around 400 keV at L∗=3; (5) intense CIR induce more than 50 times flux enhancement for the energy channel around 200 keV at L∗=4. These results are consistent with a general picture of enhanced convection over a longer period for CIR storms which increased flux closer to geosynchronous orbit consistent with earlier studies, while CME storms likely produce deeper penetration of enhanced flux and local heating which is greater at higher energies at lower L∗.},

@book{Kelbert2020,
abstract = {Geomagnetic disturbances cause perturbations in the Earth's magnetic field which, by the principle of electromagnetic induction, in turn cause electric currents to flow in the Earth. These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) also enter man-made technological conductors that are grounded; notably, telegraph systems, submarine cables and pipelines, and, perhaps most significantly, electric power grids, where transformer groundings at power grid substations serve as entry points for GICs. The strength of the GICs that flow through a transformer depends on multiple factors, including the spatiotemporal signature of the geomagnetic disturbance, the geometry and specifications of the power grid, and the electrical conductivity structure of the Earth's subsurface. Strong GICs are hazardous to power grids and other infrastructure; for example, they can severely damage transformers and thereby cause extensive blackouts. Extreme space weather is therefore hazardous to man-made technologies. The phenomena of extreme geomagnetic disturbances, including storms and substorms, and their effects on human activity are commonly referred to as geomagnetic hazards. Here, we provide a review of relevant GIC studies from around the world and describe their common and unique features, while focusing especially on the effects that the Earth's electrical conductivity has on the GICs flowing in the electric power grids.},

Of particular concern is the current practice of coupling the internal induced field for convenience to the external field by a real constant, independent of the frequency content of the external inducing source. The error introduced into field models by this simplified representation is of the order of 5 nT on average. Here, we propose an accurate representation of the symmetric part of the disturbance field which is easy to implement. Using a 1D conductivity model of the Earth, we split the disturbance Dst index into two new indices, Est and Ist, which track the transient evolution of the symmetric part of the external and induced disturbance field.

abstract = {Maps of extreme value geoelectric field amplitude are constructed for the Mid-Atlantic United States, a region with high population density and critically important power grid infrastructure. Geoelectric field time series for the years 1983–2014 are estimated by convolving Earth surface impedances obtained from 61 magnetotelluric survey sites across the Mid-Atlantic with historical 1 min (2 min Nyquist) measurements of geomagnetic variation obtained from a nearby observatory. Statistical models are fitted to the maximum geoelectric amplitudes occurring during magnetic storms, and extrapolations made to estimate threshold amplitudes only exceeded, on average, once per century. For the Mid-Atlantic region, 100 year geoelectric exceedance amplitudes have a range of almost 3 orders of magnitude (from 0.04 V/km at a site in southern Pennsylvania to 24.29 V/km at a site in central Virginia), and they have significant geographic granularity, all of which is due to site-to-site differences in magnetotelluric impedance. Maps of these 100 year exceedance amplitudes resemble those of the estimated geoelectric amplitudes attained during the March 1989 magnetic storm, and, in that sense, the March 1989 storm resembles what might be loosely called a “100 year” event. The geoelectric hazard maps reported here stand in stark contrast with the 100 year geoelectric benchmarks developed for the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.},

We find that LSTM augmented by "peephole connections" from its internal cells to its multiplicative gates can learn the fine distinction between sequences of spikes spaced either 50 or 49 time steps apart without the help of any short training exemplars. Without external resets or teacher forcing, our LSTM variant also learns to generate stable streams of precisely timed spikes and other highly nonlinear periodic patterns. This makes LSTM a promising approach for tasks that require the accurate measurement or generation of time intervals.},

@article{Shprits2019,
	Abstract = {Abstract Current algorithms for the real-time prediction of the Kp index use a combination of models empirically driven by solar wind measurements at the L1 Lagrange point and historical values of the index. In this study, we explore the limitations of this approach, examining the forecast for short and long lead times using measurements at L1 and Kp time series as input to artificial neural networks. We explore the relative efficiency of the solar wind-based predictions, predictions based on recurrence, and based on persistence. Our modeling results show that for short-term forecasts of approximately half a day, the addition of the historical values of Kp to the measured solar wind values provides a barely noticeable improvement. For a longer-term forecast of more than two days, predictions can be made using recurrence only, while solar wind measurements provide very little improvement for a forecast with long horizon times. We also examine predictions for disturbed and quiet geomagnetic activity conditions. Our results show that the paucity of historical measurements of the solar wind for high Kp results in a lower accuracy of predictions during disturbed conditions. Rebalancing of input data can help tailor the predictions for more disturbed conditions.},

	Abstract = {Several researchers characterized the activation function under which multilayer feedforward networks can act as universal approximators. We show that most of all the characterizations that were reported thus far in the literature are special cases of the following general result: A standard multilayer feedforward network with a locally bounded piecewise continuous activation function can approximate any continuous function to any degree of accuracy if and only if the network's activation function is not a polynomial. We also emphasize the important role of the threshold, asserting that without it the last theorem does not hold.},

@article{Bolduc2002,
	Abstract = {On March 13, 1989, at 7 h 45 UT, Hydro-Qu{\'e}bec experienced a complete black-out of its system due to a severe geomagnetic storm. Consequently, service was interrupted for many hours and overvoltages resulting from line openings cost 6.5 M$ in material damages alone among a total of 13.2 M$. In 1991, geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) produced some effects and damages on the Radisson--Sandy Pond HVDC link. On March 24, at 21h55 UT, GIC larger than 110A were measured in one of two transformers in parallel (presumably, giving a total of 220 A) at Radisson substation which led to the loss of the HVDC link. The same thing happened on October 28, but this time with material damages to equipment. From these events, short-term studies led to the upgrading of operational processes, modifications of opening thresholds of Static Var Compensators and modifications of some filters at Radisson. Also an agreement was concluded with Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) for sending a warning alert to the Network Control Centre (CCR) before any anticipated severe geomagnetic storms. Among more long-term studies, in collaboration with GSC, we have installed 5 acquisition substations along a 250-km long copper telephone line in Abitibi, a site typical of Hydro-Qu{\'e}bec facilities, and from 1992 to 1994 measured ground voltages and magnetic fields every 10s. The highest ground voltage measured at Louvicourt substation was ∼1.70V/km for 20s. Asymmetry measurement of line voltages, based on techniques developed at IREQ in the 1980s, have been upgraded, the number of installations has been increased (from 4 to 8) and functions like harmonic measurement have been added. Voltage asymmetries over a fixed threshold produce an alarm at the CCR, which reacts by taking security measures in network operation. During March 1989 and 1991 events, voltage asymmetry grew to 9.6% and 15.5%, respectively, at the Arnaud substation. A major change, for needs of network stability during short circuit or other contingencies, has been the installation of series compensation in 1996 into the Hydro-Qu{\'e}bec 735-kV network. Since capacitors block DC current, the observed asymmetry has remained about 20% of that observed before. So, now, we are confident that our network would survive the anticipated worst case GIC.},
