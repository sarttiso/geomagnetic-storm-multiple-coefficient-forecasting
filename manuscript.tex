\begin{abstract}
Geomagnetic storms, which are governed by the plasma magnetohydrodynamics of the solar-interplanetary-magnetosphere system, entail a formidable challenge for physical forward modeling. Yet, the abundance of high quality observational data has been amenable for the application of data-hungry neural networks to geomagnetic storm forecasting. Previous applications of neural networks to storm forecasting have utilized solar wind observations from the Earth-Sun first Lagrangian point (L1) or closer and have all generated deterministic output without uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, forecasting work has focused on indices that are also sensitive to induced internal magnetic fields, complicating the forecasting problem with another layer of non-linearity. We address these points, presenting neural networks trained on observations from both the solar disk and the L1 point. Our architecture generates reliable probabilistic forecasts over Est, the external component of the disturbance storm time index, showing that neural networks can gauge confidence in their output.
\end{abstract}


\section*{Plain Language Summary}
Geomagnetic storms are capable of damaging infrastructure like power grids and communication lines, motivating our need to forecast them. Solar phenomena produce geomagnetic storms, which occur when these phenomena reach Earth as bursts of the solar wind. Decades of satellite observations of both the solar wind near the Earth and of the Sun itself are promising for forecasting geomagnetic storms with algorithms known as neural networks. Several neural network architectures have been applied to geomagnetic storm forecasting, but their full potential remains unexplored. First, all existing neural networks have used measurements of the solar wind one hour upstream of the Earth or closer. While these observations are critical for understanding geomagnetic storm progression, from them it is nearly impossible to forecast more than an hour in advance. We include observations of the Sun itself, which reach Earth much faster than the solar wind, thereby including information for forecasting further in advance. Second, all existing neural networks have generated forecasts without uncertainty estimates, meaning that end-users (such as utilities or telecommunications companies) know little about forecast confidence. We present an architecture that generates estimates of uncertainty, and our results demonstrate that neural networks learn how confident to be in their forecasts.

\begin{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
